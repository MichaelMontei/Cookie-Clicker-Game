## Dragon Ball Z-Clicker Game##

- Came up with a theme: dragonball Z Power Theme 
- First thought about the layout
- Added Html Components / CSS layout 
- Added a function to count clicks on the dragonball. Also added a function to reset the clicks. 
- Added a function to multiply and have no credit
- Added a function to calculate the difference between when buying an upgrade and start the interval 2s function.
- Repository of Cookie Clicker broke, had GET 404 error I tried to resolve -> made new repo Dragonball Z.
- Checked some more layout the had more spacing between the divs content-left and right.
